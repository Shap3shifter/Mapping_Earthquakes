# Mapping_Earthquakes

For this exercise we took earthquakes that have occurred over the past 7 days and fault line data and added them as an overlay to a world map. An earthquake is indicated by two attributes - the size of the circle and the color of it. The larger the circle, the larger the earthquake and that also correlates with the color that is indicated by the legend at the bottom right corner of the map. 

Further, the user can toggle between displaying the fault lines, the subset of earthquakes with larger magnitudes, and the entire earthquake set themselves. The user is also able to toggle between the type of map that is displayed whether it be a street view, satellite view, or dark mode.

It's a pretty neat map - enjoy!
